columnName,columnDescription
bblid,The subject's internal BBL identifier
scanid,The identifier of the subject's scan session
idemoExclude,A binary flag indicating whether the subject should be excluded from ROI-wise analysis of IDEMO data; defined as the set union of exclusions on the basis of mean and maximum motion and executive activation and missing data; exclusionary if true â˜­
idemoVoxelwiseExclude,A binary flag indicating whether the subject should be excluded from voxelwise analysis of IDEMO data; defined as the set union of exclusions on the basis of mean and maximum motion and executive activation and missing data and voxelwise coverage; exclusionary if true
idemoNoDataExclude,A binary flag indicating whether IDEMO imaging data has been collected for the subject; exclusionary if true
idemoRelMeanRMSMotion,The average framewise ('relative') movement of the subject in mm according to the root-mean-square metric as computed in MCFLIRT
idemoRelMeanRMSMotionExclude,A binary flag indicating whether whether the subject should be excluded on the basis of excessive (> 0.5 mm) mean relative movement; exclusionary if true
idemoRelMaxRMSMotion,The maximal framewise ('relative') movement (for any single frame) of the subject in mm according to the root-mean-square metric as computed in MCFLIRT
idemoRelMaxRMSMotionExclude,A binary flag indicating whether whether the subject should be excluded on the basis of excessive (> 6 mm) maximal relative movement; exclusionary if true
idemoNormCrossCorr,The spatial cross-correlation between the binarised template brain and the binarised subject brain following normalisation to the template; a metric of registration quality
idemoNormCoverage,The fractional spatial coverage of the binarised template brain by the binarised subject brain following normalisation to the template; a metric of registration quality
idemoCoregCrossCorr,The spatial cross-correlation between the binarised structural brain and the binarised functional brain following co-registration to the structural brain; a metric of co-registration quality
idemoCoregCoverage,The fractional spatial coverage of the binarised structural brain by the binarised functional brain following co-registration to the structural brain; a metric of co-registration quality
idemoVoxelwiseCoverageExclude,A binary flag indicating whether the subject should be excluded from voxelwise analyses on the basis of insufficient coverage of brain tissue; exclusionary if true
idemoMeanActivationExclude,A binary flag indicating whether the subject should be excluded as an outlier according to activation in the executive system in response to IDEMO stimuli; exclusionary if true
idemoRpsMapCorrectionNotApplied, A binary flag indicating whether distortion correction was applied to the IDEMO timeseries; no distortion correction if true
