columnName,columnDescription
bblid,The subject's internal BBL identifier
scanid,The identifier of the subject's scan session
restExclude,A binary flag indicating whether the subject should be excluded from ROI-wise analysis of resting data; defined as the set union of exclusions on the basis of relative motion and motion spikes and missing data; exclusionary if true â˜­
restVoxelwiseExclude,A binary flag indicating whether the subject should be excluded from ROI-wise analysis of resting data; defined as the set union of exclusions on the basis of relative motion and motion spikes and missing data and voxelwise coverage; exclusionary if true
restNoDataExclude,A binary flag indicating whether rest imaging data has been collected for the subject; exclusionary if true
restRelMeanRMSMotion,The average framewise ('relative') movement of the subject in mm according to the root-mean-square metric as computed in MCFLIRT
restRelMeanRMSMotionExclude,A binary flag indicating whether whether the subject should be excluded on the basis of excessive (> 0.2 mm) mean relative movement; exclusionary if true
restNSpikesMotion,The number of frames that exhibited high levels of motion (>.25mm) according to the root-mean-square metric as computed in MCFLIRT
restNSpikesMotionExclude,A binary flag indicating whether whether the subject should be excluded on the basis of an excessive number (> 20) of high-motion frames; exclusionary if true
restNormCrossCorr,The spatial cross-correlation between the binarised template brain and the binarised subject brain following normalisation to the template; a metric of registration quality
restNormCoverage,The fractional spatial coverage of the binarised template brain by the binarised subject brain following normalisation to the template; a metric of registration quality
restCoregCrossCorr,The spatial cross-correlation between the binarised structural brain and the binarised functional brain following co-registration to the structural brain; a metric of co-registration quality
restCoregCoverage,The fractional spatial coverage of the binarised structural brain by the binarised functional brain following co-registration to the structural brain; a metric of co-registration quality
restVoxelwiseCoverageExclude,A binary flag indicating whether the subject should be excluded from voxelwise analyses on the basis of insufficient coverage of brain tissue; exclusionary if true
restRpsMapCorrectionNotApplied, A binary flag indicating whether distortion correction was applied to the resting timeseries; no distortion correction if true
