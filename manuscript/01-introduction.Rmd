# Introduction

  There is increased availability of multi-modality neuroimaging data on individual subjects, where each modality contains unique information about brain structure or function. Such data promises to allow us to explore not only patterns in individual modalities, but also how patterns in individual modalities relate to each other. In addition to these comparisons, multi-modal data allows us to observe the local covariance structure, or intermodal coupling (IMCo), between modalities. This local covariance structure can be interpreted as how modalities change with respect to one another at the voxel level in individual subjects.
  
  Previous studies have shown IMCo analysis is complementary to single-modality analysis and unveils otherwise undetectable findings. For example, in neurodevelopment, IMCo between cortical thickness and sulcal depth has suggested the cortical sheet is generally thinner in sulcal locations when compared to gyral locations, though this relationship was more spatially heterogeneous than previously described[@vandekar_subject-level_2016]. Additionally, this study showed the strength of coupling was lower in males compared to females and decreased with age. A separate study exploring IMCo between cerebral blood flow and amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) showed that age-related declines in neurovascular coupling occurred most drastically during mid-adolescence and were enriched in the dorsal attention network[@baller_developmental_2021]. There were also differences in CBF-ALFF coupling between males and females; these differences were enriched in the frontoparietal network. In multiple sclerosis, IMCo has also shown use as a data augmentation tool to improve predictive accuracy of an automated lesion detection model over models using individual modality data alone[@valcarcelMIMoSAAutomatedMethod2018].
  
  In these prior studies, each voxel-wise coupling value was defined as the slope of the weighted regression lines for that local neighborhood between two modalities. However, since this method of calculating IMCo is based on regression slopes, it suffers from inherent asymmetry, where coupling values depend on the order in which modalities are listed - this necessitates arbitrary, yet influential, decision-making when it comes to analysis and inhibits straight-forward interpretation. Such a measure for IMCo is also limited to only two modalities, so study of coupling between more than two modalities would require analysis of all pairwise coupling maps. As the number of total modalities increase, this quickly becomes overwhelming.
  
  Here, we propose a novel, PCA-based method of estimating IMCo which uses local covariance decomposition to define symmetric voxel-wise coupling values valid for two or more modalities. Thus, our approach provides a more natural and interpretable way of describing coupling in settings with two modalities and allows for simplified study of overall local covariance structure in settings with more than two modalities. To demonstrate its sensitivity to biologically relevant patterns, we show PCA-based IMCo uncovers differences in three-modality coupling with respect to age and sex throughout neurodevelopment.
