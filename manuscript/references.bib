  abstract = {Background and purpose Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for in vivo detection and characterization of white matter lesions (WML) in multiple sclerosis (MS). The most widely established MRI outcome measure is the volume of hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted images (T2L). Unfortunately, T2L are non-specific for the level of tissue destruction and show a weak relationship to clinical status. Interest in lesions that appear hypointense on T1-weighted images (T1L) (“black holes”) has grown because T1L provide more specificity for axonal loss and a closer link to neurologic disability. The technical difficulty of T1L segmentation has led investigators to rely on time-consuming manual assessments prone to inter- and intra-rater variability. This study aims to develop an automatic T1L segmentation approach, adapted from a T2L segmentation algorithm. Materials and methods T1, T2, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences were acquired from 40 MS subjects at 3 Tesla (3 T). T2L and T1L were manually segmented. A Method for Inter-Modal Segmentation Analysis (MIMoSA) was then employed. Results Using cross-validation, MIMoSA proved to be robust for segmenting both T2L and T1L. For T2L, a Sørensen-Dice coefficient (DSC) of 0.66 and partial AUC (pAUC) up to 1\% false positive rate of 0.70 were achieved. For T1L, 0.53 DSC and 0.64 pAUC were achieved. Manual and MIMoSA segmented volumes were correlated and resulted in 0.88 for T1L and 0.95 for T2L. The correlation between Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) scores and manual versus automatic volumes were similar for T1L (0.32 manual vs. 0.34 MIMoSA), T2L (0.33 vs. 0.32), and the T1L/T2L ratio (0.33 vs 0.33). Conclusions Though originally designed to segment T2L, MIMoSA performs well for segmenting T1 black holes in patients with MS.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for in vivo detection and characterization of white matter lesions (WMLs) in multiple sclerosis. While WMLs have been studied for over two decades using MRI, automated segmentation remains challenging. Although the majority of statistical techniques for the automated segmentation of WMLs are based on single imaging modalities, recent advances have used multimodal techniques for identifying WMLs. Complementary modalities emphasize different tissue properties, which help identify interrelated features of lesions. METHODS: Method for Inter-Modal Segmentation Analysis (MIMoSA), a fully automatic lesion segmentation algorithm that utilizes novel covariance features from intermodal coupling regression in addition to mean structure to model the probability lesion is contained in each voxel, is proposed. MIMoSA was validated by comparison with both expert manual and other automated segmentation methods in two datasets. The first included 98 subjects imaged at Johns Hopkins Hospital in which bootstrap cross-validation was used to compare the performance of MIMoSA against OASIS and LesionTOADS, two popular automatic segmentation approaches. For a secondary validation, a publicly available data from a segmentation challenge were used for performance benchmarking. RESULTS: In the Johns Hopkins study, MIMoSA yielded average Sørensen-Dice coefficient (DSC) of .57 and partial AUC of .68 calculated with false positive rates up to 1\%. This was superior to performance using OASIS and LesionTOADS. The proposed method also performed competitively in the segmentation challenge dataset. CONCLUSION: MIMoSA resulted in statistically significant improvements in lesion segmentation performance compared with LesionTOADS and OASIS, and performed competitively in an additional validation study.},

  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

Here, we define novel measures of relative power (rPWR, extent of concurrent energy utilization and activity) and relative cost (rCST, extent that energy utilization exceeds activity), derived from FDG-PET and fMRI. We show that resting-state networks have distinct energetic signatures and that brain could be classified into major bilateral segments based on rPWR and rCST. While medial-visual and default-mode networks have the highest rPWR, frontoparietal networks have the highest rCST. rPWR and~rCST estimates are generalizable to other indexes of energy supply and neuronal activity, and are sensitive to neurocognitive effects of acute and chronic alcohol exposure. rPWR and rCST are informative metrics for characterizing brain pathology and alternative energy use, and may provide new multimodal biomarkers of neuropsychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Although diagnosing the syndrome of dementia is largely a clinical endeavor, neuroimaging plays an increasingly important role in accurately determining the underlying etiology, which extends beyond its traditional role in excluding other causes of altered cognition. New neuroimaging methods not only facilitate the diagnosis of the most common neurodegenerative conditions (particularly Alzheimer Disease [AD]) after symptom onset, but also show diagnostic promise even in the very early or presymptomatic phases of disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) is increasingly recognized as a key clinical tool for differentiating normal age-related changes in brain metabolism (using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose [FDG]) from those seen in the earliest stages of specific forms of dementia. However, FDG PET only demonstrates nonspecific changes in altered parenchymal glucose uptake and not the specific etiologic proteinopathy causing the abnormal glucose uptake. A growing class of radiotracers targeting specific protein aggregates for amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau are changing the way AD is diagnosed, as these radiotracers directly label the underlying disease pathology. As these pathology-specific radiotracers are currently making their way to the clinic, it is important for the clinical neuroradiologist to understand the underlying patterns of Aβ and tau deposition in the context of AD (across its clinical continuum) and in other causes of dementia, as well as understand the implications of current research.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) and antecedent factors associated with AD were explored using amyloid imaging and unbiased measures of longitudinal atrophy in combination with reanalysis of previous metabolic and functional studies. In total, data from 764 participants were compared across five in vivo imaging methods. Convergence of effects was seen in posterior cortical regions, including posterior cingulate, retrosplenial, and lateral parietal cortex. These regions were active in default states in young adults and also showed amyloid deposition in older adults with AD. At early stages of AD progression, prominent atrophy and metabolic abnormalities emerged in these posterior cortical regions; atrophy in medial temporal regions was also observed. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging studies further revealed that these cortical regions are active during successful memory retrieval in young adults. One possibility is that lifetime cerebral metabolism associated with regionally specific default activity predisposes cortical regions to AD-related changes, including amyloid deposition, metabolic disruption, and atrophy. These cortical regions may be part of a network with the medial temporal lobe whose disruption contributes to memory impairment.},

  abstract = {The association between functional connectivity (FC) alterations with amyloid-β (Aβ) and τ protein depositions in Alzheimer dementia is a subject of debate in the current literature. Although many studies have suggested a declining FC accompanying increased Aβ and τ concentrations, some investigations have contradicted this hypothesis. Therefore, this systematic review was conducted to sum up the current literature in this regard. The PROSPERO guideline for systematic reviews was applied for development of a research protocol, and this study was initiated after getting the protocol approval. Studies were screened, and those investigating FC measured by resting-state functional MRI and Aβ and τ protein depositions using amyloid and τ positron emission tomography were included. We categorized the included studies into 3 groups methodologically, addressing the question using global connectivity analysis (examining all regions of interest across the brain based on a functional atlas), seed-based connectivity analysis, or within-networks connectivity analysis. The quality of the studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Among 31 included studies, 14 found both positive and negative correlations depending on the brain region and stage of the investigated disease, while 7 showed an overall negative correlation, 8 indicated an overall positive correlation, and 2 found a nonsignificant association between protein deposition and FC. The investigated regions were illustrated using tables. The posterior default mode network, one of the first regions of amyloid accumulation, and the temporal lobe, the early τ deposition region, are the 2 most investigated regions where inconsistencies exist. In conclusion, our study indicates that transneuronal spreading of τ and the amyloid hypothesis can justify higher FC related to higher protein depositions when global connectivity analysis is applied. However, the discrepancies observed when investigating the brain locally could be due to the varying manifestations of the amyloid and τ overload compensatory mechanisms in the brain at different stages of the disease with hyper- and hypoconnectivity cycles that can occur repeatedly. Nevertheless, further studies investigating both amyloid and τ deposition simultaneously while considering the stage of Alzheimer dementia are required to assess the accuracy of this hypothesis.},

  abstract = {While machine learning approaches to analyzing Alzheimer disease connectome neuroimaging data have been studied, many have limited ability to provide insight in individual patterns of disease and lack the ability to provide actionable information about where in the brain a specific patient's disease is located. We studied a cohort of patients with Alzheimer disease who underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tractography imaging. These images were processed, and a structural and functional connectivity matrix was generated using the HCP cortical and subcortical atlas. By generating a machine learning model, individual-level structural and functional anomalies detection and characterization were explored in this study. Our study found that structural disease burden in Alzheimer's patients is mainly focused in the subcortical structures and the Default mode network (DMN). Interestingly, functional anomalies were less consistent between individuals and less common in general in these patients. More intriguing was that some structural anomalies were noted in all patients in the study, namely a reduction in fibers involving parcellations in the right anterior cingulate. Alternately, the functional consequences of connectivity loss were cortical and variable. Integrated structural/functional connectomics might provide a useful tool for assessing AD progression, while few concerns have been made for analyzing the mismatch between these two. We performed a preliminary exploration into a set of Alzheimer disease data, intending to improve a personalized approach to understanding individual connectomes in an actionable manner. Specifically, we found that there were consistent patterns of white matter fiber loss, mainly focused around the DMN and deep subcortical structures, which were present in nearly all patients with clinical AD. Functional magnetic resonance imaging shows abnormal functional connectivity different within the patients, which may be used as the individual target for further therapeutic strategies making, like non-invasive stimulation technology.},

  abstract = {Background: Neuroimaging studies suggest that aged brains show altered connectivity within and across functional networks. Similar changes in functional network integrity are also linked to the accumulation of pathological proteins in the brain, such as amyloid-beta plaques and neurofibrillary tau tangles seen in Alzheimer's disease. However, less is known about the specific impacts of amyloid and tau on functional network connectivity in cognitively normal older adults who harbor these proteins. Methods: We briefly summarize recent neuroimaging studies of aging and then thoroughly review positron emission tomography and functional magnetic resonance imaging studies measuring the relationship between amyloid–tau pathology and functional connectivity in cognitively normal older individuals. Results: The literature overall suggests that amyloid-positive older individuals show minor cognitive dysfunction and aberrant default mode network connectivity compared with amyloid-negative individuals. Tau, however, is more closely associated with network hypoconnectivity and poorer cognition. Those with substantial amyloid and tau experience even greater cognitive decline compared with those with primarily amyloid or tau, suggesting a potential interaction. Multimodal neuroimaging studies suggest that older adults with pathological protein deposits show amyloid-related hyperconnectivity and tau-related hypoconnectivity in multiple functional networks, including the default mode and frontoparietal networks. Discussion: We propose an updated model considering the effects of amyloid and tau on functional connectivity in older individuals. Large, longitudinal neuroimaging studies with multiple levels of analysis are required to obtain a deeper understanding of the dynamic relationship between pathological protein accumulation and functional connectivity changes, as amyloid- and tau-induced connectivity alterations may have critical and time-varying effects on neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Impact statement Amyloid and tau accumulation have been linked with altered functional connectivity in cognitively normal older adults. This review synthesized recent functional imaging literatures in a discussion of how amyloid and tau can interactively affect functional connectivity in nonlinear ways, which can explain previous conflicting findings. Changes in connectivity strength may depend on the accumulation of both amyloid and tau, and their integrative effects seem to have critical consequences on cognition. Elucidating the effects of these pathological proteins on brain functioning is paramount to understand the etiology of Alzheimer's disease and the aging process overall.},

  abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {Participant motion during functional magnetic resonance image (fMRI) acquisition produces spurious signal fluctuations that can confound measures of functional connectivity. Without mitigation, motion artefact can bias statistical inferences about relationships between connectivity and individual differences. To counteract motion artefact, this protocol describes the implementation of a high-performance denoising strategy that combines a set of model features, including physiological signals, motion estimates, and mathematical expansions, to target both widespread and focal effects of subject movement. This method can reduce motion-related variance to near zero in studies of functional connectivity, providing up to a hundredfold improvement over minimal processing approaches in large data sets. Image denoising requires 40 minutes to 4 hours of computing per image, depending on model specifications and data dimensionality. The protocol additionally includes instructions for assessing the performance of a denoising strategy. Associated software implements all denoising and diagnostic procedures using a combination of established image processing libraries (FSL, AFNI, and ANTs) and new pipeline software (the XCP system, downloadable from Github: http://github.com/PennBBL/xcpEngine).},

  abstract = {To support brain development during youth, the brain must balance energy delivery and consumption. Previous studies in adults have demonstrated high coupling between cerebral blood flow and brain function as measured using functional neuroimaging, but how this relationship evolves over adolescence is unknown. To address this gap, we studied a sample of 831 children and adolescents (478 females, ages 8-22) from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort who were scanned at 3T with both arterial spin labeled (ASL) MRI and resting-state functional MRI (fMRI). Local coupling between cerebral blood flow (CBF, from ASL) and the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF, from fMRI) was first quantified using locally weighted regressions on the cortical surface. We then used generalized additive models to evaluate how CBF-ALFF coupling was associated with age, sex, and executive function. Enrichment of effects within canonical functional networks was evaluated using spin-based permutation tests. Our analyses revealed tight CBF-ALFF coupling across the brain. Whole-brain CBF-ALFF coupling decreased with age, largely driven by coupling decreases in the inferior frontal cortex, precuneus, visual cortex, and temporoparietal cortex (pfdr {$<$}0.05). Females had stronger coupling in the frontoparietal network than males (pfdr {$<$}0.05). Better executive function was associated with decreased coupling in the somatomotor network (pfdr {$<$}0.05). Overall, we found that CBF-ALFF coupling evolves in development, differs by sex, and is associated with individual differences in executive function. Future studies will investigate relationships between maturational changes in CBF-ALFF coupling and the presence of psychiatric symptoms in youth. SIGNIFICANCE The functions of the human brain are metabolically expensive and reliant on coupling between cerebral blood flow and neural activity. Previous neuroimaging studies in adults demonstrate tight physiology-function coupling, but how this coupling evolves over development is unknown. Here, we examine the relationship between blood flow as measured by arterial spin labeling and the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations from resting-state magnetic resonance imaging across a large sample of youth. We demonstrate regionally specific changes in coupling over age and show that variations in coupling are related to biological sex and executive function. Our results highlight the importance of CBF-ALFF coupling throughout development; we discuss its potential as a future target for the study of neuropsychiatric diseases.},

PFIT was supported and extended in adult samples, but not in youths or within single-scanner well-powered multimodal studies. We performed multimodal neuroimaging in 1601 youths age 8–22 on the same 3-Tesla scanner with contemporaneous neurocognitive assessment, measuring volume, gray matter density (GMD), mean diffusivity (MD), cerebral blood flow (CBF), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging measures of the amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFFs) and regional homogeneity (ReHo), and activation to a working memory and a social cognition task. Across age and sex groups, better performance was associated with higher volumes, greater GMD, lower MD, lower CBF, higher ALFF and ReHo, and greater activation for the working memory task in PFIT regions. However, additional cortical, striatal, limbic, and cerebellar regions showed comparable effects, hence PFIT needs expansion into an extended PFIT (ExtPFIT) network incorporating nodes that support motivation and affect. Associations of brain parameters became stronger with advancing age group from childhood to adolescence to young adulthood, effects occurring earlier in females. This ExtPFIT network is developmentally fine-tuned, optimizing abundance and integrity of neural tissue while maintaining a low resting energy state.},

Alternatively, the power of low frequency fluctuation (LFF) may also be used as a biomarker to assess spontaneous activity. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate whether the amplitude of the LFF (ALFF) relates to cerebral physiological states. Ten healthy subjects underwent four resting-state fMRI scanning sessions, two for eyes-open (EO) and two for eyes-closed (EC) conditions, with two sets of parameters (TR=400 ms and 2 s, respectively). After data preprocessing, ALFF was obtained by calculating the square root of the power spectrum in the frequency range of 0.01-0.08 Hz. Our results showed that the ALFF in EO was significantly higher than that in EC (P{$<$}0.05, corrected) in the bilateral visual cortices. Furthermore, the ALFF in EO was significantly reduced in the right paracentral lobule (PCL) than in EC (P{$<$}0.05, corrected). Region of interest (ROI) analysis showed that the ALFF differences between EO and EC were consistent for each subject. In contrast, no significant ALFF differences were found between EO and EC (P{$<$}0.381) in the posterior cingulate cortex. All these results agree well with previous studies comparing EO and EC states. Our finding of the distinct ALFF difference between EO and EC in the visual cortex implies that the ALFF may be a novel biomarker for physiological states of the brain.},

In the present study, a new method was developed based on the regional homogeneity (ReHo), in which KCC was used to measure the similarity of the time series of a given voxel to those of its nearest neighbors in a voxel-wise way. Six healthy subjects performed left and right finger movement tasks in event-related design; five of them were additionally scanned in a rest condition. KCC was compared among the three conditions (left finger movement, right finger movement, and the rest). Results show that bilateral primary motor cortex (M1) had higher KCC in either left or right finger movement condition than in rest condition. Contrary to prediction and to activation pattern, KCC of ipsilateral M1 is significantly higher than contralateral M1 in unilateral finger movement conditions. These results support the previous electrophysiologic findings of increasing ipsilateral M1 excitation during unilateral movement. ReHo can consider as a complementary method to model-driven method, and it could help reveal the complexity of the human brain function. More work is needed to understand the neural mechanism underlying ReHo.},

  abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan–Killiany–Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan–rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

However, many of the most commonly used techniques have not been systematically evaluated using a broad range of outcome measures. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 14 participant-level confound regression methods in 393 youths. Specifically, we compare methods according to four benchmarks, including the residual relationship between motion and connectivity, distance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, network identifiability, and additional degrees of freedom lost in confound regression. Our results delineate two clear trade-offs among methods. First, methods that include global signal regression minimize the relationship between connectivity and motion, but result in distance-dependent artifact. In contrast, censoring methods mitigate both motion artifact and distance-dependence, but use additional degrees of freedom. Importantly, less effective de-noising methods are also unable to identify modular network structure in the connectome. Taken together, these results emphasize the heterogeneous efficacy of existing methods, and suggest that different confound regression strategies may be appropriate in the context of specific scientific goals.},

Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669±0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

While many algorithms to register image pairs from the same subject exist, visual inspection shows that their accuracy and robustness to be suspect, particularly when there are strong intensity gradients and/or only part of the brain is imaged. This paper introduces a new algorithm called Boundary-Based Registration, or BBR. The novelty of BBR is that it treats the two images very differently. The reference image must be of sufficient resolution and quality to extract surfaces that separate tissue types. The input image is then aligned to the reference by maximizing the intensity gradient across tissue boundaries. Several lower quality images can be aligned through their alignment with the reference. Visual inspection and fMRI results show that BBR is more accurate than correlation ratio or normalized mutual information and is considerably more robust to even strong intensity inhomogeneities. BBR also excels at aligning partial-brain images to whole-brain images, a domain in which existing registration algorithms frequently fail. Even in the limit of registering a single slice, we show the BBR results to be robust and accurate.},

Here we quantify regional SC-FC coupling in healthy young adults using diffusion-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI data from the Human Connectome Project and study how SC-FC coupling may be heritable and varies between individuals. We show that regional SC-FC coupling strength varies widely across brain regions, but was strongest in highly structurally connected visual and subcortical areas. We also show interindividual regional differences based on age, sex and composite cognitive scores, and that SC-FC coupling was highly heritable within certain networks. These results suggest regional structure-function coupling is an idiosyncratic feature of brain organisation that may be influenced by genetic factors.},

When neuronal activity, as measured using functional MRI (fMRI), is temporally coherent across 2 populations, those populations are said to be functionally connected. Functional connectivity has previously been shown to correlate with structural (anatomical) connectivity patterns at an aggregate level. In the present study we investigate, with the aid of computational modeling, whether systems-level properties of functional networks—including their spatial statistics and their persistence across time—can be accounted for by properties of the underlying anatomical network. We measured resting state functional connectivity (using fMRI) and structural connectivity (using diffusion spectrum imaging tractography) in the same individuals at high resolution. Structural connectivity then provided the couplings for a model of macroscopic cortical dynamics. In both model and data, we observed (i) that strong functional connections commonly exist between regions with no direct structural connection, rendering the inference of structural connectivity from functional connectivity impractical; (ii) that indirect connections and interregional distance accounted for some of the variance in functional connectivity that was unexplained by direct structural connectivity; and (iii) that resting-state functional connectivity exhibits variability within and across both scanning sessions and model runs. These empirical and modeling results demonstrate that although resting state functional connectivity is variable and is frequently present between regions without direct structural linkage, its strength, persistence, and spatial statistics are nevertheless constrained by the large-scale anatomical structure of the human cerebral cortex.},

However, despite extensive use of the FDG-PET method, the significance of the measured CMRglc has been little addressed so far. In the present study, we aimed for the first time to test whether resting-state CMRglc is directly related to synaptic density. To this end, we investigated in the baboon the relationships between CMR(glc) and the levels of synaptophysin (SY), a presynaptic protein classically used to assess synaptic density. CMR(glc), measured in vivo by FDG-PET at the resting-state, and SY levels, assessed postmortem by the Western blot technique, were quantified in seven brain areas of five baboons. By applying these two techniques to the same animals, we found significant positive correlations between CMR(glc) and SY levels, across all regions and all animals, as well as within individual baboons. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that resting-state CMR(glc) reflects integrated synaptic activity.},

  abstract = {In recent years, the brain's “default network,” a set of regions characterized by decreased neural activity during goal-oriented tasks, has generated a significant amount of interest, as well as controversy. Much of the discussion has focused on the relationship of these regions to a “default mode” of brain function. In early studies, investigators suggested that, the brain's default mode supports “self-referential” or “introspective” mental activity. Subsequently, regions of the default network have been more specifically related to the “internal narrative,” the “autobiographical self,” “stimulus independent thought,” “mentalizing,” and most recently “self-projection.” However, the extant literature on the function of the default network is limited to adults, i.e., after the system has reached maturity. We hypothesized that further insight into the network's functioning could be achieved by characterizing its development. In the current study, we used resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) to characterize the development of the brain's default network. We found that the default regions are only sparsely functionally connected at early school age (7–9 years old); over development, these regions integrate into a cohesive, interconnected network.},

  abstract = {Cognitive function evolves significantly over development, enabling flexible control of human behavior. Yet, how these functions are instantiated in spatially distributed and dynamically interacting networks, or graphs, that change in structure from childhood to adolescence is far from understood. Here we applied a novel machine-learning method to track continuously overlapping and time-varying subgraphs in the brain at rest within a sample of 200 healthy youth (ages 8–11 and 19–22) drawn from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. We uncovered a set of subgraphs that capture surprisingly integrated and dynamically changing interactions among known cognitive systems. We observed that subgraphs that were highly expressed were especially transient, flexibly switching between high and low expression over time. This transience was particularly salient in a subgraph predominantly linking frontoparietal regions of the executive system, which increases in both expression and flexibility from childhood to young adulthood. Collectively, these results suggest that healthy development is accompanied by an increasing precedence of executive networks and a greater switching of the regions and interactions subserving these networks.Our ability to thoughtfully engage with the world around us changes appreciably as we transition from childhood to adulthood. Yet, how our brains develop to enable that change remains far from understood. Here we used network science—traditionally applied to the study of social networks like Facebook or Twitter—and machine learning to show that growing cognitive abilities are accompanied by greater flexibility of brain regions within distributed networks. This flexibility is greatest in the executive system, which is critical for higher-order cognitive functions and increases in expression and flexibility from childhood to young adulthood. These results suggest that healthy development is facilitated by an increasing precedence of executive networks and a greater switching of the regions and interactions subserving these networks.},

  abstract = {Structural neuroimaging studies suggest altered brain maturation in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) compared with typically developing controls (TDC). However, the prognostic value of whole-brain structural connectivity analysis in ASD has not been established. Diffusion magnetic imaging data were acquired in 27 high-functioning young ASD participants (2 females) and 29 age-matched TDC (12 females; age 8–18 years) at baseline and again following 3–7 years. Whole-brain structural connectomes were reconstructed from these data and analyzed using a longitudinal statistical model. We identified distinct patterns of widespread brain connections that exhibited either significant increases or decreases in connectivity over time (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). There was a significant interaction between diagnosis and time in brain development (p\,{$<$}\,0.001). This was expressed by a decrease in structural connectivity within the frontoparietal network—and its broader connectivity—in ASD during adolescence and early adulthood. Conversely, these connections increased with time in TDC. Crucially, stronger baseline connectivity in this subnetwork predicted a lower symptom load at follow-up (p\,=\,0.048), independent of the expression of symptoms at baseline. Our findings suggest a clinically meaningful relationship between the atypical development of frontoparietal structural connections and the dynamics of the autism phenotype through early adulthood. These results highlight a potential marker of future outcome.},

  abstract = {There has been tremendous interest in applying functional magnetic resonance imaging-based resting-state functional connectivity (rs-fcMRI) measurements to the study of brain function. However, a lack of understanding of the physiological mechanisms of rs-fcMRI limits their ability to interpret rs-fcMRI findings. In this work, the authors examine the regional associations between rs-fcMRI estimates and dynamic coupling between the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) and cerebral blood flow (CBF), as well as resting macrovascular volume. Resting-state BOLD and CBF data were simultaneously acquired using a dual-echo pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) technique, whereas macrovascular volume fraction was estimated using time-of-flight MR angiography. Functional connectivity within well-known functional networks—including the default mode, frontoparietal, and primary sensory-motor networks—was calculated using a conventional seed-based correlation approach. They found the functional connectivity strength to be significantly correlated with the regional increase in CBF-BOLD coupling strength and inversely proportional to macrovascular volume fraction. These relationships were consistently observed within all functional networks considered. Their findings suggest that highly connected networks observed using rs-fcMRI are not likely to be mediated by common vascular drainage linking distal cortical areas. Instead, high BOLD functional connectivity is more likely to reflect tighter neurovascular connections, attributable to neuronal pathways.},

  abstract = {The human cortex is highly folded to allow for a massive expansion of surface area. Notably, the thickness of the cortex strongly depends on cortical topology, with gyral cortex sometimes twice as thick as sulcal cortex. We recently demonstrated that global differences in thickness between gyral and sulcal cortex continue to evolve throughout adolescence. However, human cortical development is spatially heterogeneous, and global comparisons lack power to detect localized differences in development or psychopathology. Here we extend previous work by proposing a new measure – local cortical coupling – that is sensitive to differences in the localized topological relationship between cortical thickness and sulcal depth. After estimation, subject-level coupling maps can be analyzed using standard neuroimaging analysis tools. Capitalizing on a large cross-sectional sample (n=932) of youth imaged as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we demonstrate that local coupling is spatially heterogeneous and exhibits nonlinear development-related trajectories. Moreover, we uncover sex differences in coupling that indicate divergent patterns of cortical topology. Developmental changes and sex differences in coupling support its potential as a neuroimaging phenotype for investigating neuropsychiatric disorders that are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of brain development. R code to estimate subject-level coupling maps from any two cortical surfaces generated by FreeSurfer is made publicly available along with this manuscript.},
