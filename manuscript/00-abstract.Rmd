# Abstract

  When individual subjects are imaged with multiple modalities, biological information is present not only within each modality, but also between modalities -- that is, in how modalities covary at the voxel level. Previous studies have shown that the covariance structures between modalities -- called intermodal coupling (IMCo) -- can be estimated between two modalities, and that two-modality IMCo reveals otherwise undiscovered patterns in neurodevelopment as well as other processes. However, previous IMCo methods are based on the slopes of local weighted linear regression lines, which are inherently asymmetric and limited to the two-modality setting. Here, we present a PCA-based generalization of IMCo regression which uses local covariance decompositions to define a symmetric, voxel-wise coupling coefficient that is valid for two or more modalities. We use this method to study coupling between cerebral blood flow, resting state fluctuations, and functional connectivity in 803 subjects ages 8 through 23. We demonstrate that coupling is spatially heterogeneous and varies with respect to age and sex over the course of neurodevelopment. As availability of multi-modal data continues to increase, principal-component-based IMCo (pIMCo) offers a powerful approach for summarizing relationships between multiple aspects of brain structure and function. An R package for pIMCo is available at: https://github.com/hufengling/IMCo_PCA.
